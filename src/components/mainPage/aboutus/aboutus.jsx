                        Toronto Island Wardâ€™s terminal is within a couple minutes walk to the beaches, island village and restaurants on the east side of the Toronto Island. Centre Island is about a 15 min walk and Hanlanâ€™s Point is a longer walk through nature or a comfortable bike ride.

                        On weekends, the public Toronto Island Ferry, does not assign you a departure time when purchasing online, has hours-long wait times and typically sells out in the morning. Private water taxis from various points can not be reserved and see long lineups and difficulty with parking. Use the Otterguy water taxi and Skip the Lines! - you'reÂ welcomeÂ ðŸ™‚
