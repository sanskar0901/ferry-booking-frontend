                        Toronto Island Wardâ€™s terminal is within a couple minutes walk to the beaches, island village and restaurants on the east side of the Toronto Island. Centre Island is about a 15 min walk and Hanlanâ€™s Point is a longer walk through nature or a comfortable bike ride.

                        In the event of inclement weather or police water emergency the service may be cancelled - youâ€™ll be notified through email and your purchase <b className="text-[#FFC60B]">refunded</b> - you may re-book right away for another available departure time.

                        The public Toronto Island Ferry sells ticket online but does not assign you a departure time - this results in hours-long wait times on weekends. Private water taxis from various points can not be reserved and see weekend lineups and difficulty with parking. <b className="text-[#FFC60B]">Use the Otterguy water taxi and Skip the Lines!</b> - you're welcome ðŸ™‚
